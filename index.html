        <p> Road bike adalah jenis sepeda untuk dikendarai dengan
            kecepatan tinggi di jalan raya. Dalam keseharian, sering disebut sebagai 'sepeda balap' meskipun sepeda balap sendiri ada banyak jenisnya dan tidak semua dipakai di jalan raya.</p>

    As the name suggests, achieving the lightest possible completed bike is the goal for lightweight bikes.
    Lightweight bikes tend to fall in the middle of many performance features of true aero and endurance bikes, making them the bike of choice for General Classification riders and team leaders. They aren't as comfortable as an endurance bike, but typically moreso than an aero bike.
    They aren't as stiff as an aero bike, but stiffer than endurance bikes. The handling is a lot sharper than an endurance bike and on par with an aero bike, although with the reduced weight is even more agile. The braking can't match a disc equipped endurance bike but it's much better than an aero bike that often compromises braking for aerodynamics.

        The main priority of aerodynamic bikes is to reduce drag and be as slippery as possible in the wind. 85% of resistance a rider needs to overcome is from themselves, so it makes sense to reduce a riders frontal profile as much as possible. As a result, the headtube on aero bikes is short creating a lower frontal profile and having less resistance to overcome. As a general rule the headtube on a medium sized aero bike will be under 140mm, opposed to an endurance bike which will be over 160mm.
    Working in combination with a short headtube, aero bikes will have a longer frame reach than endurance bikes. Reach is measured horizontally from the centre of the bottom bracket axle to the headtube. The frame reach will provide an insight into the purpose of the bike.

        The purpose of endurance bikes is to be comfortable, robust and durable. They were first created to smooth out the cobbles of Northern France in professional 'Classics' races. These races are all-day affairs at high speeds across the roughest roads imaginable. To try and remove the fatigue caused to the riders by road vibration, 'endurance' bikes were created with built in compliance and greater clearance to allow for larger, more shock absorbing tyres.
